# Automated-File-moving-
The project demonstrates, the automated system to move a file from one folder to another.It is quite helpful to manage the files in the system.

This program will monitor a target folder and if it detects any file moved to the target folder, it will automatically move the file to the destination folder.

The practical application of this is, to move the file from the downloads folder to a target folder so as the files be properly managed.
If we make the downloads folder as the target folder, as soon as a file is downloaded and placed in the downloads folder, it will be moved automatically to a destination folder of our choice.

The program also renames the files as they are moved.
